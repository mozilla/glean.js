# v0.32.0 (2022-03-01)

[Full changelog](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/compare/v0.31.0...v0.32.0)

* [#1220](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/1220): Refactor virtual environment behavior to support virtual environments that aren't in the project root.
* [#1130](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/1130): BUGFIX: Guarantee event timestamps
cannot be negative numbers.
  * Timestamps were observed to be negative in a few occurrences, for platforms that do not provide the `performance.now` API, namely QML, and in which we fallback to the `Date.now` API.
  * If event timestamps are negative pings are rejected by the pipeline.
* [#1132](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/1132): Retry ping request on network error with `keepalive: false`. This is sometimes an issue on Chrome browsers below v81.
* [#1170](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/1170): Update glean_parser to version 5.0.0.
* [#1178](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/1178): Enable running the `glean` command offline.
  * When offline Glean will not attempt to install glean_parser.
* [#1178](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/1178): Enable running the `glean` command with as many or as little arguments as wanted.
  * Previously the command could only be run with 3 commands, even though all glean_parser commands would have been valid commands for the `glean` CLI.
* [#1210](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/1210): Show comprehensive error message when missing `storage` permissions for Glean on web extensions.
* [#1223](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/1223): Add `--glean-parser-version` command to CLI to allow users to retrieve the glean_parser version without installing glean_parser.
* [#1228](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/1228): BUGFIX: Apply debug features before sending pings at initialize.

# v0.31.0 (2022-01-25)

[Full changelog](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/compare/v0.30.0...v0.31.0)

* [#1065](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/1065): Delete minimal amount of data when invalid data is found while collecting ping.
  * Previous behavior was to delete the whole ping when invalid data was found on the database,
  new behavior only deletes the actually invalid data and leave the rest of the ping intact.
* [#1065](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/1065): Only import metric types into the library when they are used either by the user or Glean itself.
  * Previously the code required to deserialize metric data from the database was always imported by the library even if the metric type was never used by the client. This effort will decrease the size of the Glean.js bundles that don't import all the metric types.
* [#1046](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/1046): Remove legacy X-Client-Type X-Client-Version from Glean pings.
* [#1071](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/1071): **BREAKING CHANGE**: Move the `testResetGlean` API from the Glean singleton and into it's own entry point `@mozilla/glean/testing`.
  * In order to use this API one must import it through `import { testResetGlean } from "@mozilla/glean/testing"` instead of using it from the Glean singleton directly.
  * This lower the size of the Glean library, because testing functionality is not imported unless in a testing environment.
  * This change does not apply to QML. In this environment the API remains the same.

# v0.30.0 (2022-01-10)

[Full changelog](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/compare/v0.29.0...v0.30.0)

* [#1045](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/1045): BUGFIX: Provide informative error message when unable to access database in QML.
* [#1077](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/1077): BUGFIX: Do not clear lifetime metrics before submitting `deletion-request` ping on initialize.
  - This bug causes malformed `deletion-request` pings in Glean is initialized with `uploadEnabled=false`.

# v0.29.0 (2022-01-04)

[Full changelog](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/compare/v0.28.0...v0.29.0)

* [#1006](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/1006): Implement the rate metric.
* [#1066](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/1066): BUGFIX: Guarantee reported timestamps are never floating point numbers.
  * Floating point timestamps are rejected by the pipeline.

# v0.28.0 (2021-12-08)

[Full changelog](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/compare/v0.27.0...v0.28.0)

* [#984](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/984): BUGFIX: Return correct upload result in case an error happens while building a ping request.
* [#988](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/988): BUGFIX: Enforce rate limitation at upload time, not at ping submission time.
  * Note: This change required a big refactoring of the internal uploading logic.
* [#994](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/994): Automatically restart ping upload once the rate limit window is ended.
  * Prior to this change, ping uploading would only be resumed once the `.submit()` API was called again, even if Glean was not throttled anymore.
  * **Note**: this change does not apply to QML. We used the `setTimeout`/`clearTimeout` APIs in this feature and those are not available on the QML platform. Follow [Bug 1743140](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1743140) for updates.
* [#1015](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/1015): BUGFIX: Make attempting to call the `setUploadEnabled` API before initializing Glean a no-op.
* [#1016](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/1016): BUGFIX: Make shutdown a no-op in case Glean is not initialized.

* [#981](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/981): Update rate limits for ping submission from 15 pings/minute to 40 pings/minute.
* [#967](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/967): **BREAKING CHANGE**: Remove `debug` option from Glean configuration option.
  * The `Glean.setDebugViewTag`, `Glean.setSourceTags` and `Glean.setLogPings` should be used instead. Note that these APIs can safely be called prior to initialization.

# v0.26.0 (2021-11-19)

[Full changelog](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/compare/v0.25.0...v0.26.0)

* [#965](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/965): Attempt to infer the Python virtualenv folder from the environment before falling back to the default `.venv`.
  * Users may provide a folder name through the `VIRTUAL_ENV` environment variable.
  * If the user is inside an active virtualenv the `VIRTUAL_ENV` environment variable is already set by Python. See: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html.
* [#968](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/968): Add runtime arguments type checking to `Glean.setUploadEnabled` API.
* [#970](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/970): BUGFIX: Guarantee uploading is immediately resumed if the uploader has been stopped due to any of the uploading limits being hit.

# v0.25.0 (2021-11-15)

[Full changelog](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/compare/v0.24.0...v0.25.0)

* [#924](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/924): Only HTTPS server endpoints outside of testing mode.
  * In testing mode HTTP may be used. No other protocols are allowed.
* [#951](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/951): Expose Uploader, UploadResult and UploadResultStatus.
  * These are necessary for creating custom uploaders. Especially from TypeScript.

# v0.24.0 (2021-11-04)

[Full changelog](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/compare/v0.23.0...v0.24.0)

* [#856](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/856): Expose the `@mozilla/glean/web` entry point for using Glean.js in websites.
* [#856](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/860): Implement the `PlatformInfo` module for the web platform.
  * Out of `os`, `os_version`, `architecture` and `locale`, on the web platform, we can only retrieve `os` and `locale` information. The other information will default to the known value `Unknown` for all pings coming from this platform.
* [#856](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/856): Expose the `@mozilla/glean/web` entry point for using Glean.js in websites.
* [#908](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/908): BUGFIX: Guarantee internal `uploadEnabled` state always has a value.
  * When `uploadEnabled` was set to `false` and then Glean was restarted with it still `false`, the internal `uploadEnabled` state was not being set. That should not cause particularly harmful behavior, since `undefined` is still a "falsy" value. However, this would create a stream of loud and annoying log messages.
* [#898](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/898): Implement the `Storage` module for the web platform.

# v0.23.0 (2021-10-12)

[Full changelog](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/compare/v0.22.0...v0.23.0)

* [#755](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/755): Only allow calling of `test*` functions in "test mode".
  * Glean is put in "test mode" once the `Glean.testResetGlean` API called.
* [#811](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/811): Apply various fixes to the Qt entry point file.
  * Expose `ErrorType`. This is only useful for testing purposes;
  * Fix version of `QtQuick.LocalStorage` plugin;
  * Fix the way to access the lib from inside the `shutdown` method. Previous to this fix, it is not possible to use the `shutdown` method;
  * Expose the `Glean.testRestGlean` API.
* [#822](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/822): Fix API reference docs build step.
* [#825](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/825): Accept `architecture` and `osVersion` as initialization parameters in Qt. In Qt these values are not easily available from the environment.
