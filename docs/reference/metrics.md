This project may depend on other projects which also collect metrics.
This means you might have to go searching through the dependency tree to get a full picture of everything collected by this project.

## all-pings

These metrics are sent in every ping.

All Glean pings contain built-in metrics in the [`ping_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-ping_info-section) and [`client_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-client_info-section) sections.

In addition to those built-in metrics, the following metrics are added to the ping:

| Name | Type | Description | Data reviews | Extras | Expiration | [Data Sensitivity](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Data_Collection) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| glean.client.annotation.experimentation_id |[string](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/string.html) |An experimentation identifier derived and provided by the application for the purpose of experimentation enrollment.  |[Bug 1848201](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1848201#c5)||never |1 |
| glean.error.invalid_label |[labeled_counter](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/labeled_counters.html) |Counts the number of times a metric was set with an invalid label. The labels are the `category.name` identifier of the metric.  |[Bug 1499761](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1499761#c5)||never |1 |
| glean.error.invalid_overflow |[labeled_counter](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/labeled_counters.html) |Counts the number of times a metric was set a value that overflowed. The labels are the `category.name` identifier of the metric.  |[Bug 1591912](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1591912#c3)||never |1 |
| glean.error.invalid_state |[labeled_counter](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/labeled_counters.html) |Counts the number of times a timing metric was used incorrectly. The labels are the `category.name` identifier of the metric.  |[Bug 1499761](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1499761#c5)||never |1 |
| glean.error.invalid_value |[labeled_counter](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/labeled_counters.html) |Counts the number of times a metric was set to an invalid value. The labels are the `category.name` identifier of the metric.  |[Bug 1499761](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1499761#c5)||never |1 |
| glean.restarted |[event](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/event.html) |Event that signals an application restart.  **This event is included in all pings (custom or otherwise) that contain events.**  |[mozilla/glean.js#526](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/pull/526#issuecomment-889892100)||never |1 |

## deletion-request

This is a built-in ping that is assembled out of the box by the Glean SDK.

See the Glean SDK documentation for the [`deletion-request` ping](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/deletion-request.html).

This ping is sent if empty.

This ping includes the [client id](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-client_info-section).

**Data reviews for this ping:**

- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1587095#c6>

**Bugs related to this ping:**

- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/1587095>

**Reasons this ping may be sent:**

- `at_init`: The ping was submitted at startup.
      Glean discovered that between the last time it was run and this time,
      upload of data has been disabled.

- `set_upload_enabled`: The ping was submitted between Glean init and Glean shutdown.
      Glean was told after init but before shutdown that upload has changed
      from enabled to disabled.


All Glean pings contain built-in metrics in the [`ping_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-ping_info-section) and [`client_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-client_info-section) sections.

This ping contains no metrics.

## events

This is a built-in ping that is assembled out of the box by the Glean SDK.

See the Glean SDK documentation for the [`events` ping](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/events.html).

This ping includes the [client id](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-client_info-section).

**Data reviews for this ping:**

- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1512938#c3>

**Bugs related to this ping:**

- <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/1512938>

**Reasons this ping may be sent:**

- `inactive`: The ping was submitted when becoming inactive. In earlier versions, this
      was called `background`.

      NOTE: It is not possible to find a definition of "inactivity" that spans
      all of the platforms served by the Glean JavaScript SDK.
      This reason is only listed here for documentation purposes.
      It is never reported by the JavaScript SDK.

- `max_capacity`: The maximum number of events was reached (default 1 event).

- `startup`: The ping was submitted at startup.
      The events ping is always sent if there are any pending events at startup,
      because event timestamps are not as reliable across application runs.


All Glean pings contain built-in metrics in the [`ping_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-ping_info-section) and [`client_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-client_info-section) sections.

In addition to those built-in metrics, the following metrics are added to the ping:

| Name | Type | Description | Data reviews | Extras | Expiration | [Data Sensitivity](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Data_Collection) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| glean.element_click |[event](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/event.html) |A event triggered whenever an html element is clicked on a page.  **Clicks are recorded only for those html elements that have at least one of the `data-glean-*` data attributes. By default, this event is not collected automatically. Collection can be turned on by clients via Glean configuration object (`enableAutoElementClickEvents`). Glean also provides a separate API for clients to record element clicks manually.**  |[Bug 1867294](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1867294#c29)|<ul><li>id: An identifier of the element clicked. For automatic collection, its value is the element's `data-glean-id` data attribute value.</li><li>label: The label of the element clicked. For automatic collection, its value is the element's `data-glean-label` data attribute value.</li><li>type: The type of the element clicked. For automatic collection, its value is the element's `data-glean-type` data attribute value.</li></ul>|never |2 |
| glean.page_id |[uuid](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/uuid.html) |Uniquely identifies a page_load, not the page itself, for the purpose of associating other events with the specific page load event. This gets rotated with each page load and is sent along with each event ping.  |[Bug 1888430](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1888430)||never |1 |
| glean.page_load |[event](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/event.html) |A event triggered whenever a page is loaded.  **This event by default is not collected automatically. This can be turned on by the client in the Glean configuration object (`enableAutoPageLoadEvents`). Glean provides a separate API for collecting the same page load data if the client wants to collect page loads manually.**  |[Bug 1867126](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1867126#c8)|<ul><li>referrer: The page referrer.</li><li>title: The page title.</li><li>url: The page URL.</li></ul>|never |2 |
