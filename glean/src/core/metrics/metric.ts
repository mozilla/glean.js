 * The Metric class describes the shared behaviour amongst concrete metrics.
 *
 * A concrete metric will always have two possible representations:
 *
 * - `InternalRepresentation`
 *    - Is the format in which this metric will be stored in memory.
 *    - This format may contain extra metadata, in order to allow deserializing of this data for testing purposes.
 * - `PayloadRepresentation`
 *    - Is the format in which this metric will be represented in the ping payload.
 *    - This format must be the exact same as described in [the Glean schema](https://github.com/mozilla-services/mozilla-pipeline-schemas/blob/master/schemas/glean/glean/glean.1.schema.json).
