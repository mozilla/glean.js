## Bug reports / Feature Requests

If you are using Glean.js and found a bug or a missing feature, please file a bug.

Glean.js bugs are filed in Bugzilla. Use [this link](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?assigned_to=nobody%40mozilla.org&bug_ignored=0&bug_severity=normal&bug_status=NEW&bug_type=defect&cf_fx_iteration=---&cf_fx_points=---&cf_status_firefox100=---&cf_status_firefox101=---&cf_status_firefox99=---&cf_status_firefox_esr91=---&cf_tracking_firefox100=---&cf_tracking_firefox101=---&cf_tracking_firefox99=---&cf_tracking_firefox_esr91=---&component=Glean%3A%20SDK&contenttypemethod=list&contenttypeselection=text%2Fplain&defined_groups=1&filed_via=standard_form&flag_type-4=X&flag_type-607=X&flag_type-721=X&flag_type-737=X&flag_type-799=X&flag_type-800=X&flag_type-803=X&flag_type-936=X&flag_type-947=X&form_name=enter_bug&maketemplate=Remember%20values%20as%20bookmarkable%20template&op_sys=Unspecified&priority=P3&product=Data%20Platform%20and%20Tools&rep_platform=Unspecified&status_whiteboard=%5Bglean-sdk%3Am%3F%5D%5Bglean-js%5D&target_milestone=---&version=unspecified)
to file a bug in the Glean SDK Bugzilla component.

## Finding a bug to work on

As mentioned, Glean.js bugs are filed in Bugzilla. Anything on the Glean SDK component
with the tag [`[good first bug]`](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?f1=status_whiteboard&o1=substring&component=Glean%3A%20SDK&query_format=advanced&resolution=---&classification=Client%20Software&classification=Developer%20Infrastructure&classification=Components&classification=Server%20Software&classification=Other&v1=%5Bgood-first-bug%5D%5Bglean-js%5D&list_id=16044682)
is a good place to start.

These bugs will usually have a comment explaining the steps to get started working on them.
(If you find a `[good first bug]` that doesn't have an explanation comment, please ask for one).

If you are picking a good first bug or not, make sure you are assigned to the bug before sending a Pull Request for it.

> **Note** When you do send a Pull Request, make sure its title starts `Bug <number of the bug> - `, 
> this triggers an action to attach your Pull Request to the Bugzilla bug you are working on.
